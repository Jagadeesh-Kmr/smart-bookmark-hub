🧩 Challenges Faced & How I Solved Them
1️⃣ Google OAuth Redirect Issues
Problem:

After implementing Google login, authentication failed due to redirect URI mismatch errors.

Root Cause:

The Supabase project URL, local development URL, and Vercel production URL were not properly configured inside:

Supabase Auth settings

Google Cloud Console OAuth settings

Solution:

Added correct redirect URIs in Supabase:

https://PROJECT_ID.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback


Added both:

http://localhost:3000

https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app
inside Google Cloud Console Authorized Origins & Redirect URIs.

After aligning all URLs correctly, authentication worked seamlessly.

2️⃣ Real-Time Updates Not Triggering
Problem:

Bookmarks were not updating in real-time across multiple tabs.

Root Cause:

Supabase Realtime was not properly subscribed to the postgres_changes channel, and initially, I forgot to enable Realtime on the table.

Solution:

Enabled Realtime for the bookmarks table in Supabase.

Implemented a proper channel subscription using:

supabase
  .channel("realtime-bookmarks")
  .on("postgres_changes", { event: "*", schema: "public", table: "bookmarks" }, ...)
  .subscribe()


Now when a bookmark is added or deleted in one tab, it instantly updates in another.

3️⃣ Data Privacy (Critical Issue)
Problem:

Initially, all users could see each other’s bookmarks.

Root Cause:

Row Level Security (RLS) was not enabled, so Supabase returned all rows.

Solution:

Enabled RLS on the bookmarks table.

Added policies:

Users can SELECT only their own bookmarks.

Users can INSERT only with their own user_id.

Users can DELETE only their own bookmarks.

This ensured complete user data isolation.

4️⃣ React Keys Warning (Important UI Challenge)
Problem:

React showed warnings:

Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.


Additionally, when deleting a bookmark, sometimes the wrong item visually disappeared or UI behaved unexpectedly.

Root Cause:

Initially, I used the array index as the key:

{bookmarks.map((bookmark, index) => (
  <div key={index}>...</div>
))}


Using array index as key caused unstable rendering when:

Items were deleted

Real-time updates reordered data

Multiple tabs updated simultaneously

React relies on stable keys to correctly identify elements during reconciliation. When using index as key, React mismatched components during state updates.

Solution:

Used the unique id generated by Supabase as the key:

{bookmarks.map((bookmark) => (
  <div key={bookmark.id}>...</div>
))}


This fixed:

Incorrect re-renders

UI glitches during deletion

Real-time sync inconsistencies

React warnings

Using stable database IDs ensures predictable rendering and proper DOM reconciliation.

5️⃣ Session Persistence Issue
Problem:

On refresh, user session sometimes appeared lost.

Root Cause:

Session state was not properly fetched on initial render.

Solution:

Used:

supabase.auth.getSession()


and also listened to:

supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()


This ensured session persistence across reloads.

🧠 What I Learned

Importance of Row Level Security for multi-user apps

Why stable React keys are critical for predictable UI updates

How React reconciliation works internally

How Supabase Realtime subscriptions function

Proper OAuth configuration in production environments

Managing environment variables securely in Vercel

🔐 Security Considerations

RLS policies prevent cross-user data leaks

No client-side filtering for privacy


🌍 Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel.

Production build:
      npm run build

Environment variables were added in Vercel dashboard before deployment.

📦 Future Improvements

Bookmark editing feature

Bookmark categories / tags

Search & filtering

Drag-and-drop sorting

Folder organization

Rate limiting

Optimistic UI updates
